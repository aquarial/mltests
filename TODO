Here is a general list of planned tasks. Feel free to suggest tasks that you feel are interesting/useful


Simple logic gates (or, and, not, unary identity, nor, ) : STATUS: almost completely done

COMPLETED: needs bias node to successfully learn not and nor
a proper population management algorithm will necesarry to virtually guarantee timely success(xor sometimes gets stuck)


Addition: STATUS: incomplete

this is an open problem, currently the brain does not learn a model for addition in linear time.
mutation params need to be refactored to be mutable, and this problem will also likely benefit from subpopulation

best acheived accuracy is 78%




survival microworld: STATUS: incomplete

the most interesting open problem here. Much more valuable as and excercise than the addition problem, as a discrete mapping of states couldn't possible 
work in a sufficently complicated microworld. 


goal tiles need to be added to microworld
a survival time assessment function needs to be added to the microworld
