Here is a general list of planned tasks. Feel free to suggest tasks that you feel are interesting/useful


-------------- GENERAL TODO --------------
-- Make a clear function for the brain
-- wrap mallocs with asserts
-- Use arraylist structures for neurons
-- Start thinking about Temporal stuff!  (John and Will have ideas about this)

-- Learning Brain:  STATUS: incomplete
Making the brain able to learn during it's functioning time, thus making it more flexible.

Create a Module for temporal based weight adjustment.
Possibly allow for random neuron firing for creating new connections?  Gotta research this one more


-- Topologically Fluid Brain:  STATUS: incomplete
Allowing the brain to add neurons!

Create an output that adds a new neuron
Create a method for neurons dying


-------------- IN PROGRESS --------------
-- Addition: STATUS: incomplete

this is an open problem, currently the brain does not learn a model for addition in reasonable time.
mutation params need to be refactored to be mutable, and this problem will also likely benefit from subpopulation

Accuracy Leaderboard:

-William 80%; (added tanh)
-John 78%;



-- Survival Microworld: STATUS: incomplete

the most interesting open problem here. Much more valuable as an excercise than the addition problem, as a discrete mapping of states couldn't possibly 
work in a sufficently complicated microworld. 

the basic microworld has been completed, and brains have been successfully trained to survive to a satisfactory degree of success in the microworld.

-------------- FINISHED STUFF --------------
Simple logic gates (or, and, not, unary identity, nor)

COMPLETED: needs bias node to successfully learn not and nor
COMPLETED: a proper population management algorithm will necesarry to virtually guarantee timely success(xor sometimes gets stuck)
