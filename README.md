# mltests

Hi all,

This is a project with the loose goal of finding interested ways to generate intelligent agents through trial and error. 
All of the meaningful code is currently in the c directory, as we have not yet ported the project to c++. The c folder contains 
instructions regarding how to make and run the code. 

Areas that need work:

training environments:

	Python Neuro-evolution code: under construction
	openAI gym interface code: under construction

machine learning techniques:

	Modifications to neuron simulation to allow for intragenerational learning(Planned):
		currently the network can only be trained intergenerationally
		
	Implementation of Neuro Evolution through Augmenting Topology planned. 


analysis tools:

	Python graph visualization and editing tool(Under Construction):


If any of these areas sound interesting to you, don't hesitate to contribute; I can be reached at balisujohn at gmail dot com and am very interested recieve
input and contributions.
