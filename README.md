# mltests

Hi all,

This is a project with the loose goal of finding interested ways to generate intelligent agents through trial and error. 
All of the meaningful code is currently in the c directory, as we have not yet ported the project to c++. The c folder contains 
instructions regarding how to make and run the code. 

Areas that need work:

training environments:

	microworld2(Under Construction):

		A simple inverse pendulum simulation in c

	microworld3(Planned) :

		A freeform 3d environment using the gazebo simulation platform

machine learning techniques:

	Modifications to neuron simulation to allow for intragenerational learning(Planned):
		currently the network can only be trained intergenerationally


analysis tools:

	Python graph visualization and editing tool(Planned):


If any of these areas sound interesting to you, don't hesitate to contribute; I can be reached at balisujohn at gmail dot com and am very interested recieve
input and contributions.
