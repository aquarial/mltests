# mltests

Hi all,

This is a project with the loose goal of finding interested ways to generate intelligent agents through trial and error. 
All of the meaningful code is currently in the c directory, as we have not yet ported the project to c++. The c folder contains 
instructions regarding how to make and run the code.
